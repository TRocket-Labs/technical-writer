# **{Product Name} Changelog**

💡 _Open with one sentence that tells readers what this page is — what they'll find here and how often it's updated._

**Example:** "New updates and improvements to Supabase."

---

## **{Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly Update Title}**

{Date or period covered}

💡 _In 2-3 sentences, explain what this update is and why it matters to users. Lead with the user benefit, not the technical implementation._

**Example:** "Supabase Cron is now available — schedule recurring Jobs using SQL directly in the Dashboard. Use it to clean up old data, send scheduled emails, or trigger serverless functions on a timer."

ℹ️ _**Pattern Note:** Supabase structures its changelog as a rolling feed of dated entries rather than versioned releases. Major features get full write-ups with visuals and blog links. Smaller updates are batched into bulleted lists. Breaking changes are called out explicitly with timelines and migration steps. Community sections appear regularly to highlight ecosystem momentum. This creates a changelog that doubles as a product marketing surface,  where each entry is both informative and engaging._
